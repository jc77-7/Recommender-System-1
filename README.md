# Recommender-System-1
Applying NCF( NEURAL COLLABORATIVE FILTERING) on Cosmetics Dataset 

Key Features:

* **NCF Implementation (TensorFlow/Keras):** A neural network-based collaborative filtering model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
* **Implicit Feedback:** Utilizes user interactions like 'view', 'cart', and 'purchase' events to infer user preferences. Purchase events are weighted higher.
* **Brand Inclusion in Recommendations:** The recommendation function retrieves and displays the brand name along with the product ID.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Includes steps for handling missing data, filtering relevant event types, and label encoding for user and product IDs.
* **Train-Test Split:** Splits the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
* **Clear and Modular Code:** The Python script is well-structured and includes comments for better understanding.
* **Colab-Friendly:** Designed to be executed directly in a Google Colaboratory notebook.
